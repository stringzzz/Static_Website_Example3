# Static_Website_Example3

Instead of creating a website as if I'm doing it for a client, I decided to try making one with a theme that I'm actually interested in. The theme I thought of was Pokemon, since that is a big interest of mine, but I decided to narrow it down to my favorite type, Ghosts, that way it would be easier to cover everything. 

This was the biggest web project I've done so far, and basically its a fan page for Ghost Pokemon. I threw in a little bit of everything I've learned so far. I'm about 2 months into learning HTML and CSS now, and so far it has been pretty fun, except of course when things aren't working right.

I'm not going to say this project is 100% finished, because I know how that always goes. I will likely be adding some extra stuff or just redesign for a while until I feel satisfied.
